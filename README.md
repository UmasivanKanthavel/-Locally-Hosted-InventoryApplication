# Locally-Hosted-InventoryApplication

I made this inventory application just to get hands-on with Java and better understand how object-oriented programming actually works in practice. I used JavaFX to build a simple interface for tracking clothing inventory at Sakthi Silk, and it gave me strong foundational knowledge about inheritance and the MVC design pattern in a real project. Honestly, it was a fun way to learn how to organize code better and make something that felt practical.
